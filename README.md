# 🐠 Happy Birthday, Angel Fish! 🌊

## 🌊 The Poem

> And I am not one to place my faith in fate or destiny's design,  
> But if such forces breathe between the stars,
> 
> They must have aligned to choose me and lead me to you,  
> As if some quiet current knew this is where I belong.
> 
> Drifting through the ocean, I realize now,  
> Every mile of open water simply was preparing me to recognize your sparkle,
> 
> The unmistakable shimmer of the one fish  
> I was meant to swim beside.
> 
> With you, the darkest trenches fill with colours, the coldest waters, warmth.  
> With you, every wave becomes a rhythm and ripple, music.
> 
> So on this day - your day,  
> I want to express my vastness of gratitude,  
> Drown you in the depths of my love,  
> The endless devotion I worship you with.
> 
> May your heart be kissed by gentle tides,  
> May your spirit glisten like sunlit water,  
> And may you always know you are cherished,  
> Beyond words, beyond metaphor, beyond measure.

## 🎂 For My Angel Fish

Because some things can't be expressed with just words.  
Because you deserve something as unique as you are.  
Because among a thousand repositories, this one is for you.
